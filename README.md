# 12KEMP V2.1  (W.I.P)
### This project does require intermediate soldering skills.
12KEMP V2.1 is a 12 key 4 by 3 macropad, that features a Waveshare RP2350-LCD-0.96 with vial-qmk support, a clickable rotary encoder, a completely custom pcb with hot-swap support for 3/5-pin regular MX switches, as well as a complete case. All related files are in this repo, and you may create any form of case to mount the pcb onto, though it may take some time. Additionally, a bill of materials (BOM) is included. 
This project is made for the [**hackclub blueprint**](https://blueprint.hackclub.com) event.
